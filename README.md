* #### *`WHAT`* is Super4minions website.
  A one page portfolio built to give you an overview about who we are as a team of three dedicated, really fun coding bootcamp student-developers! 

  And also to show you what we can do for a first attempt to build a simple wesite from scratch taking into consideration our clients' stories and other features.

* #### *`WHY`* are we doing this.
  >“Everybody in this country should learn to program, should learn a computer language because it teaches you how to think.”   —Steve Jobs

  We believe learning is an endless process and that is one of the main reasons we have decided to join the coding bootcamp, because we want to put what's in our heads into a set of actions to achieve sensible results of our own ideas and help ourselves -and others- to develop a comprehensive understanding of concepts and teamwork and this portfolio website is only the start!

* #### *`HOW`* it all started.
  **1. Clients stories.**
[Users stories](https://github.com/gazaskygeeks/bootcamp/blob/master/coursebook/week1/project.md) tell us what needs to be included in the website and what features/requirements we need to focus on. In the case of this project:
  * Headline about the team with concise description.
  * Navigation link to sections; About, Team and Contact.
  * Form with Name, email address and Message of the inquirer.
  * Small devices compatibility.
  * Visual impairment compatibility.
  * Screen reader compatibilty.
  * Old browsers/devices (IE7) compatibility.

  **2. Sketching and wireframing.**

   One page layout.
   Four main sections; Home, About, Team and Contact Us.
   Each section is conected via JavaScript to its menu button.

  **3. Writing the `HTML` code.**
  
  **4. Writing the `CSS` code.**
  
  **5. Working on the content of the site.**
  
  **6. Fetching the README file.**
  
  **7. Working with github through the building process.**
   *It's worth mentioning here that we had conflict issues when merging branches but managed to fix it with the help of our super cool instructor.*
   
   **8. Publsihing to github pages.**
